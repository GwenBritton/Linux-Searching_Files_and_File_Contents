# Enough file system commands to be twice as productive

If you followed along with the previous CLI units, you will now be familiar with files and directories creation (`mkdir`, `touch`), removal (`rmdir`, `rm -r`) , copying (`cp`), migration and renaming (`mv`) commands.

These commands together with keyboard shortcuts increase your development productivity as you require less clicking to navigate across the file system and therefore taking less time on completing tasks.

On the other hand, using __relative__ and __absolute__ paths lets you enter or exit directory paths with ease and __execute bash commands directly from parent directories__.

Remember that the difference between _relative and absolute_ paths is simple: 

_Absolute paths_ start from the __root directory__, represented by a `/` character. While _relative paths_ start from the _current working directory_.
