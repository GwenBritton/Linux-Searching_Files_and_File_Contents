### What is a _project changelog_?

The approach of the forecoming challenges is to create a file that will contain a history of the changes made to our _project-log_ directory.

When working on real world projects, files are constantly added and updated with code or text. 

As file content grows, the versions of those files differ over time. 

This is why software updates are controlled with version labels such as: 

v1.0
v1.1.0
v2.0 

Version names are associated with features being added or bugs being corrected, which makes code easier to maintain.
