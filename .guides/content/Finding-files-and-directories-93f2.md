## Like google but for our file system

Computer storage can get really messy as we create files and directories. 

However, __if we know what we are looking for__, the `find` command can help us by getting the location of the specified files and directories information in less than a second.

### Command: 

```
find <source_path> -operand "argument"
```
__Definition:__ The `find` utility _walks_ the file system evaluating an _expression_ or argument in terms of each file in the specified _source path_.
