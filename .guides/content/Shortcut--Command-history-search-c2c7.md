As we type commands into the CLI, a special file `~/.bash_history` is appended with those commands as a tool for recording what we wrote on the prompt.

Besides the up/down keyboard arrows, there's a useful command that accesses this `~/.bash_history` file in a more advanced way. 

__Using the `ctrl + r` keyboard shortcut for searching previously input commands:__
